# Data Centre Energy & Sustainability Analytics  
*A Regression and Time-Series Modeling Framework*

---

## Overview

This repository provides a **complete analytical framework** for studying **energy efficiency and sustainability metrics of data centres**, with a special focus on **Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE)** and **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)**.

The project demonstrates how **regression techniques** and **time-series forecasting models** can be applied to understand historical patterns, identify key drivers, and forecast future sustainability performance under changing environmental and policy conditions.

The codebase is intentionally kept **simple, readable, and research-oriented**, making it suitable for:
- Academic projects  
- Sustainability research  
- Policy analysis  
- Early-stage industry analytics  
- Student demonstrations and coursework
